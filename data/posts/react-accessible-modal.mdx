Modal window (or dialog box) is one of those classic element composing an interface. Every app or website has a modal. But it's surprisingly hard to get it right.

## Accessibility Concerns About Modals

I used to think that building a modal in React is just a matter of showing a box when a variable is set to true (after a click on a button for example). But there are many things, accessibility related, to consider :

- annonce the modal and hide the rest of the page from screen reader
- make the first element <kbd>tab</kbd>-able inside the modal to have focus
- close the modal when clicking outside or when pressing <kbd>esc</kbd> key
- restore focus after closing the modal

## Using Headless Modal Component

You could try to implement a modal from scratch. But I strongly advise you against that (at least for production code).

In React, there are many headless component libraries that help developers build accessible interfaces. Headless components are a type of unstyled components that are fully functional.

You can find below few examples of headless modal libraries

- [react modal](https://reactcommunity.org/react-modal/) **(most popular)**
- [reach UI dialog](https://reach.tech/dialog/) **(what I recommand)**
- [radix UI dialog](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog)
- [reakit dialog](https://reakit.io/docs/dialog/)

[React modal](https://reactcommunity.org/react-modal/) is clearly the most popular out there. But I think it is not the best option, because you can disable some accessibility features needed for a modal.

For the other libraries, important accessibility features are enabled by default. Each of them is a good solution but I have a preference for [Reach UI dialog](https://reach.tech/dialog/) for its ease of use (simple API and component easily style-able).

## Reach UI Dialog Quickstart

### Installation

```shell
yarn add @reach/dialog
# or
npm install @reach/dialog
```

### Implementation

In this example, I use [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/). But you can use any CSS-in-JS library of your choice. You can also use CSS modules to style _DialogOverlay_ and _DialogContent_

```ts
/* FILE: src/components/reach-dialog.ts */

import { DialogOverlay, DialogContent } from "@reach/dialog"
import { styled } from "path/to/stitches.config.ts"

export const Overlay = styled(DialogOverlay, {
  backgroundColor: "hsl(0 0% 0% / 0.439)",
  position: "fixed",
  top: 0,
  bottom: 0,
  left: 0,
  right: 0,
  display: "grid",
  placeItems: "center",
})

export const Content = styled(DialogContent, {
  backgroundColor: "white",
  padding: "1rem",
  minWidth: 300,
  borderRadius: 20,
})
```

### Usage

```tsx
/* FILE: src/components/reach-dialog-demo.tsx */

import { useState } from "react"
import { Content, Overlay } from "./reach-dialog.ts"

const ReachDialogDemo = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)
  const show = () => setIsOpen(true)
  const close = () => setIsOpen(false)
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Reach Dialog Demo</h1>
      <button onClick={show}>Open Dialog</button>
      <Overlay onDismiss={close} isOpen={isOpen}>
        <Content>
          <h2>Reach dialog</h2>
          <p>Hello World</p>
          <button onClick={close}>Close</button>
        </Content>
      </Overlay>
    </main>
  )
}

export default ReachDialogDemo
```

## What About The Official _dialog_ Element ?

Although major browsers support it recently, there [are still accessibility issues](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/03/05/open-dialog.html) that are being discussed. I think, reaching for a solution like headless components is totally valid for now.
